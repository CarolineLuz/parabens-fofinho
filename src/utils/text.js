        "Parabéns meu fofinho! It's your first Corona birthday and is there a better way to celebrate it than in the good familiar four walls of our home? \
        Last year you gave me the best birthday present I ever received and I loved hunting through the house so much, I want to gift you that experience back!! \
        Several birthday goodies are hidden throughout the house, I'll be hanging on the couch catching up on my one piece during your search. \n Have fun hunting!! ",
        "Off you go my birthday boy, time to explore!",
        "Go! I' will not be useful anymore!",
        "I'll just ramble.",
        "Forever",
        "And ever",
        "Until the end of time",
        "Until you break the game",
        "Or until I have nothing left to say.",
        "Maybe I'll blurt out a 'CUTE' once in a while.",
        "Eventually I'll repeart myself.",
        "Or talk some random portuguese.",

        "Ou que tu es gato para caralho!",

        "How do you like that Ohrwurm that I just planted there, huh?",
        "Do you want a clue?",
        "On where to look?",
        "Have you tried the sofa?",
        "Or the Kallax?",
        "Everything else is pretty obvious, you are definitely smart enough to do it by yourself.",
